# Docker website example

I use this project to test things with Docker:

* Deployment
* Scalability
* Duplication

The idea is to have a really simple project with all the tools required for a
"good to go" project.  
I mean: we need to have the project in local, in staging, in prodâ€¦  
We need to develop on it, to deploy continuously, and so on.
